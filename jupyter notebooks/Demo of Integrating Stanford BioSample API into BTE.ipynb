    "This notebook demonstrates how BioThings Explorer can be used to answer the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*\"What biosamples are associated with diseases related to gene SLC15A4\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**To experiment with an executable version of this notebook, [load it in Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/master/jupyter%20notebooks/Demo%20of%20Integrating%20Stanford%20BioSample%20API%20into%20BTE.ipynb).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**: BioThings Explorer can answer two classes of queries -- \"EXPLAIN\" and \"PREDICT\".  EXPLAIN queries are described in [EXPLAIN_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/master/jupyter%20notebooks/EXPLAIN_demo.ipynb), and PREDICT queries are described in [PREDICT_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/master/jupyter%20notebooks/PREDICT_demo.ipynb). Here, we describe PREDICT queries and how to use BioThings Explorer to execute them.  A more detailed overview of the BioThings Explorer systems is provided in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QWQqqQhPD_pzKryh6Wijm4YQswv8pAjleVORCPyJyDE/edit?usp=sharing)."
