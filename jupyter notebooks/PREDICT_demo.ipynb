    "\n",
    "BioThings Explorer can answer two classes of queries -- \"EXPLAIN\" and \"PREDICT\". EXPLAIN queries are described in [EXPLAIN_demo.ipynb](EXPLAIN_demo.ipynb). Here, we describe PREDICT queries and how to use BioThings Explorer to execute them. A more detailed overview of the BioThings Explorer systems is provided in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QWQqqQhPD_pzKryh6Wijm4YQswv8pAjleVORCPyJyDE/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*\"What drugs might be used to treat hyperphenylalaninemia?\"*\n",

    "Hyperphenylalaninemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood. This phenotype is strongly associated with phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited, genetic disorder that affects the ability to metabolize phenylalanine.  **Sapropterin** is a naturally-occurring cofactor associated with several enzymatic processes, including the metabolism of phenylalanine to tyrosine. It has been [FDA-approved](https://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/drug/972/kuvan-sapropterin-dihydrochloride) as a treatment for PKU patients.  Tyrosine is also a precursor to several neurotransmitters, including **norepinephrine** and dopamine.\n",
