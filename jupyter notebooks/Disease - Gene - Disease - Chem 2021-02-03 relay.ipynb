    "This notebook demonstrates how BioThings Explorer can be used to execute queries having more than one intermediate nodes (here a \"three-hop query\").  The original posed TRAPI query was this:\n",

    "The original query starts with **\"breast cancer\" (MONDO:0007254)**.  To reduce the combinatorial explosion, I've replaced that with **\"NGLY1-deficiency\" (MONDO:0014109)** in the notebook below. The rest of the query path joins that initial disease to a `ChemicalSubstance`, joined by two intermediate nodes with type `Gene` and `Disease`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**: BioThings Explorer can answer two classes of queries -- \"EXPLAIN\" and \"PREDICT\".  EXPLAIN queries are described in [EXPLAIN_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/master/jupyter%20notebooks/EXPLAIN_demo.ipynb), and PREDICT queries are described in [PREDICT_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/blob/master/jupyter%20notebooks/PREDICT_demo.ipynb). Here, we describe PREDICT queries and how to use BioThings Explorer to execute them.  A more detailed overview of the BioThings Explorer systems is provided in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QWQqqQhPD_pzKryh6Wijm4YQswv8pAjleVORCPyJyDE/edit?usp=sharing)."
